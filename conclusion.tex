\section{Conclusion}
This paper highlights the motivations, the challenges and main requirements to build a dynamic component model for single page applications. It shows how a set of web applications running on a set of browser hosted on an heterogeneous set of devices can be considered as a common services. This lead to the need of managing the configuration of such a services from a common and abstract views. This paper presents KevoreeJS, an implementation of the Kevoree Component Model for the Browser. It evaluates this framework in building a dashboard for sensor-based applications that can be dynamically reconfigured. In particular, it supports dynamic code client/server partitioning and the dynamic component installation without refreshing the web pages.  

We are currently extended this approach for improving security and supporting analytics services and search engine optimization. We are also building a common taxonomy and a survey for comparing all the component models that exists for SPA based on the criteria discussed in section 2.
